React Recap till Date:

Day 2:

  Setup react project
    npx create-react-app --> creates the below structure

      package.json --> info about the project, dependencies/package used in project
        packages:
          react --> enables the usage jsx
          react-dom --> to create virtual dom for comparison of actual vs virtual dom
          react-scripts -->
            start ---> sets a development environment with live reloading
            build ---> optimizes the final build ( reduce/minifies javascript codes into es5 syntax understandable only browser )
      package-lock.json --> info about the packages/version of the packages and activity installation

  Undetstanding JSX:
    jsx --> javascript xml ( js file involing html like syntaxes )
    babel for converting jsx/react codes to normal codes which a browser can understand

  Components (simple HTML layout to reusable react components)

  Undetstanding the components
  Components - In depth

  Passing data through props
    curly braces is must if the props value is an object or array
    curly braces is not required if the prop value is a sting value
  
  external css class or inline style atributes:
    external css: when same style is repeated many times use external cssing
    inline style: when props dependent styling or only single tag using the style


React- Day -3 : props, state, rendering
  Working with array lists --> rendering using array map
  Usage of key --> identifying element in dom, do not use index
  Conditional rendering
    using conditional operator( ? ) similar to if/else
    using && operator only if block
  Handling Events:
    refer the onClick for Button Component in Keypad.jsx
  Props vs state

    state:
      useState ==> creates a dyanmic variable and a function to change the value
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      count --> state value which can be changed
      setCount --> function used to change the value
    
    props:
      static value passed from parent ( can be changed if the parent is re-rendered )
    statefull component:
      component using useState or someother state which changes
    stateless/pure component:
      component with only props no dynamic values state inside it
  
  passing data from child to parent == Passing dynamic data to component
    refer handleTxt

React- Day -4 : React components
  Component life cycle
  Reusable components 
  
React- Day -5 : react hooks
  What is hook?
  Lifecycle of component:
    mounting, updating, unmount
  useState, useEffect
  Props drilling

React- Day -6 : react router
  react-router-dom
  BrouserRouter, Switch, Link, Route, url params

Deploying react to netlify
